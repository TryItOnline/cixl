## All work and no Tetris
#### 2018-04-04

Tetris will always have a place in my heart; it was one of the first puzzle games I got seriously hooked on, and I still enjoy a game now and then. I find that it works much like breathing excercises in Yoga, simply following the method improves awareness indirectly by making it really inconvenient to lock focus. The game owes much of its charm to simplicity, which makes it an excellent candidate for gently bending [Cixl](https://github.com/basic-gongfu/cixl) in new directions; excercising the [ANSI graphics library](https://github.com/basic-gongfu/cixl/blob/master/examples/ansi.cx), and blowing off some steam after the recent deep dive into [cryptography](https://github.com/basic-gongfu/cixl/blob/master/devlog/turn_on_plugin_encrypt.md). The code may be found [here](https://github.com/basic-gongfu/cixl/blob/master/examples/cixtris.cx) and a Linux/64 binary over [there](https://github.com/basic-gongfu/cxbin/blob/master/linux64/cixtris).
